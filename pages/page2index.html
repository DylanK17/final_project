		<h1 class="display-3">Dylan Richardson's Final Project</h1>
		<p>This is for the Final Project. I have decided to add an improvement to the Canvas website. Canvas is
	  the application both teachers and students use to access assignments, colloborate with one another, post
	  grades, so on and so forth. On the desktop version of Canvas, there is a To Do List calendar that shows a
	  student their assignments and when they are due. The calendar follows the whole semester, as long as the
	  teachers have posted all assignments for the semester. The issue I have with the Dashboard Calendar is
	  that after scrolling down to see future assignments, to get back to where I can see the current date and
	  assignments, I have to scroll all the way back up to the top. I believe adding an additional option that
	  allows you to automatically be taken back to the current date at the top. </p>
		<p>After adding the Back to Top button, located in the bottom right corner after you start scrolling,
		I believe that the website will be much more user friendly to students like me that like to take advantage
		of the dashboard calendar. I can easily check future assignments that I will need to complete, and then I can
		easily get back to the current date with the click of a single button. All the information I just added
		in to fill the page so it would scroll. </p>
